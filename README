This is the first stable version of https://github.com/kaloyanski/meta-thc.
I freeze it to have a stable version, up-to-date with the attached Detailed Guide Document, titled:
"Manual for Custom Yocto-based minimal Linux Image for Raspberry Pi.pdf"

The original repository continues to be actively developed (as of Jan 2024).

The documentation for the original repository is located at https://kaloyanski.github.io/meta-thc.
Its updates will happen when Kaloyanski has time to do it.
